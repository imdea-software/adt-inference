TODO DEFINE REFINEMENT AND SET THE ADT INFERENCE PROBLEM

A \emph{history} $h = \tup{O,<,\ell,f,m}$ is a partial order $<$ on a set $O$
of operations with method labeling $\ell: O \to M$, completion labeling $f: O
\to \mathbb{B}$ — an operation $o \in O$ is \emph{completed} if $f(o)$
otherwise \emph{pending} — and partial matching function $m: O \rightharpoonup
O$ such that pending operations are maximal. We say $h$ is \emph{sequential}
when $<$ is a total order on $O$, and \emph{(in)complete} when (not) all
operations are completed. An operation $o \in \rng(m)$ is a \emph{match
target}, and the set $\set{ o' \in O : m(o') = o}$ of operations targeting $o$
is a \emph{match}.
